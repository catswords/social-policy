Catswords Colosseum operates user safety measures. In cases where there is a potential dispute, user safety measures may be taken. The procedure for user safety measures is as follows:

1. The user safety measure process begins with the reception of a dispute. The administrator is reachable through all available means. However, if the reception is by a third party, it may be rejected depending on the circumstances.
2. The original content creator's opinion, which caused the user safety measure process, is considered. Throughout the process, the content creator's intentions are prioritized.
3. Appropriate notification and argument procedures are conducted for all stakeholders.
4. The decision and notification of the user safety measure process are made.

The user safety measure process is initiated only after completing all these steps. However, in specific cases, the standard procedure may be skipped, and the administrator may exercise the user safety measure at their discretion.

Examples of cases subject to direct administrator action:

* Exposing genitals in content (video, photo, etc.) without appropriate audience settings, except for cases of legal, medical, academic consultation, or factual documentation, or when the content depicts non-human creations mimicking human forms.
* Intentionally including symbols indicating support for acts of genocide in content. e.g., Hakenkreuz, Rising sun flag
* Posting information on the manufacture and distribution of prohibited items (e.g., drugs, firearms) excluding those permitted by South Korean law to qualify.
* Posting content related to child labor for those under 18, excluding cases for legal, medical, academic consultation, or public interest purposes.
* Posting content that induces suicide or self-harm for an unspecified or specific individual, except for cases where the intention is not to induce such actions against others and the content pertains to the poster's own situation, allowing time to secure assistance from relevant authorities.
* Posting content simulating terrorism, allowing time to secure assistance from relevant authorities.
* Posting content that promotes illegal gambling, with the criteria based on South Korean law or general societal norms.
* Posting content simulating criminal organizations or groups.
* Using the server to harass individuals or groups (e.g., cyberbullying, hate speech).
* Using the server with the intent to cause mental or physical harm to individuals or groups.
* Suspicion of accounts created by hackers or hacker organizations seeking financial support.
* Report of the use of copyrighted material beyond the scope allowed by prior public disclosure of the copyright.

The copyright of works produced on this server follows the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) (creativecommons.org)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) unless indicated otherwise. License compliance is expected from all entities (e.g., humans, natural language processing, image processing machines) with learning capabilities, and if the entity intending to use the work is not a natural person, it must sufficiently demonstrate that the natural person representing the entity can comply with the license. Failure to do so may lead to the user safety measures mentioned earlier.

For situations where the administrator's normal functioning is not possible, the server designates a legal representative with technical authority (hereinafter 'technical representative').

1. Death
2. Missing
3. Mentally incapacitated or in a mentally deranged state
4. Detained, held hostage, or kept as a prisoner in a third country
5. Designated as wanted by domestic or international judicial authorities
6. Hiding due to threats such as from criminal organizations or private sanctions
7. Conscription due to war or a situation equivalent to a national crisis
8. Natural disaster situations such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, etc.
9. Accidents or kidnappings involving transportation methods like aviation, railways, maritime, etc.
10. Unable to be contacted or whereabouts not ascertainable for more than 24 hours through all announced means
11. Other similar situations

In the event of a similar situation, the right transfer to the technical representative prevails over the administrator. If the technical representative does not exercise the right within 5 days of being notified (or from the day a third party informs the technical representative in the case of the representative being unlocatable), the right automatically transfers to the legal representative.

* Technical Representative: Park Juyeong (ioion@catswords.re.kr)
* Scope of Technical Representative's Rights: All physical assets (servers, PCs, etc.), all electronic forms of inanimate objects (software, databases, files, etc.), all terms of cloud service contracts necessary to operate this server
* Limits of Technical Representative's Rights: Technical representative's rights occur (are acquired) only in situations where the administrator's normal functioning is not possible.

This server has prepared the following countermeasures for potential technical issues:

* If an unannounced access disruption lasts for more than three hours due to unforeseen causes, you can apply for compensation through the emergency contact. However, you must provide evidence that you attempted to access the server during the time of the disruption. The scope and amount of compensation will be determined by the administrator, considering the cause, scale, and number of affected users.
* If technical issues (such as spam, protocol errors, etc.) arise with a specific server federation, we will suspend the federation with that server for up to 72 hours (3 days). To avoid operational conflicts, the suspension will not exceed 72 hours (3 days). If the technical issue is not resolved after 72 hours (3 days), we will announce the situation and resume the federation while accommodating the issue (attempting to resolve it on our server without blocking the federation).

By joining this server, it is assumed that you agree to these rules.

These rules are effective from Jan 16, 2026, 09:00 UTC+9 (KST).
